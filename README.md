# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Hey, I'm Taylor Turner! This project was my first dive into Python coming from C++. It is a simple program that uses pygame's GUI system to create a visualization of the cocktail shaker sort algorithm.

## How it Works

The magic happens in a Pygame window where you'll see a bunch of rectangles of different heights. As you run the program, these rectangles will get sorted right before your eyes using the Cocktail Shaker algorithm.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Canvas Size**: No matter what screen you're on, the canvas adapts to be half of your current screen resolution.
- **Randomized Rectangle Heights**: Each rectangle has a unique, randomly-generated height, bounded by the canvas dimensions.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: You get to see how the sorting algorithm sorts the rectangles in real time.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python installed on your machine to run this project. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Libraries

- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

To install Pygame, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the code onto your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate and Run**: Navigate to the cloned repository's folder and simply run the Python script to see the sorting in action.
