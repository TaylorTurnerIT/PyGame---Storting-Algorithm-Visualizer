# Cocktail Shaker Sort Visualizer

This project was an exploration into Python, transitioning from C++. The goal was to utilize Pygame's GUI system to visualize the cocktail shaker sort algorithm. This program is a standalone project, aimed at providing a visual understanding of how the cocktail shaker sort algorithm operates.

# Purpose

The purpose of this program was to delve into the following areas:

    Graphical User Interface (GUI) creation using Pygame
    Algorithm visualization
    Real-time data manipulation and rendering
    Enhancing algorithm comprehension through visual representation

# Features

    Dynamic adjustment of canvas size
    Randomized rectangle heights representing data elements
    Real-time visualization of the sorting process
    Interactive user interface to control the visualization

# Installation

To install and run this program, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
    Install Pygame using the provided command.
    Run the Python script to launch the visualizer.

# Usage

Upon executing the program, a Pygame window will open displaying a set of rectangles with varying heights. As the program runs, these rectangles will be sorted using the Cocktail Shaker algorithm, visually demonstrating how the algorithm operates.

    Start: Launch the visualizer to begin sorting
    Pause/Resume: Control the visualization process
    Exit: Close the visualizer
